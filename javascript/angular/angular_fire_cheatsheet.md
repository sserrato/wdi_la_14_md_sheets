## Importing Angular/Firebase Files
1. Make sure that you have your Angular and Firebase files loaded.
2. Order does matter. The Angular file goes first. Then the Firebase file. Then you load in the Angular Fire file.
3. There are two ways to link the files into your HTML. You can have them locally on your machine or a CDN (Content Delivery Network) file hosted online.

## Steps to Add Angular to Project
1. Link Angular file in HTML head or body tags
2. Name angular module in JS file
3. Reference name of angular module in html file (ng-app)
4. Name the controller in the JS file
5. Add the scope to the controller in the JS file (glue between controller and view)
6. Add div linking the controller in the HTML by using angular directive (ng-controller)
7. Create model in JS file with scope and add data
8. Angular expressions in the view use double curlies {{ }}
